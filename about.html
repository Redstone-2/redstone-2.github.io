		About Me
	</h1>
	<p>Hello! My name is Red. I am currently a student attending the Center For Information Technology. On the projects page of this site, you'll find cards to each and every major-ish project I have worked on. I started designing websites around 7th grade and started learning programing in general sometime in early elementary school. My first exposure to programing was javascript, unlike a lot of others of my age who started with Scratch. More recently, me and a friend taught web design during an afterschool club at our school known as Computer Club. Outside of my webdev knowlage of HTML and CSS, I am also proficent in the languages listed below and can easily pick up more.<br>My Github:<a href="https://github.com/Redstone-2">https://github.com/Redstone-2</a></p>
